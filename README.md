# Bubble Sort

> This project was developed as a learning project part of the Microverse curriculum.

![screenshot](./images/screenshot.png)

Part of the learning ruby curriculum, we were tasked to create two array sorting functions. The functions are the
implementation of the bubble sort algorithm. The **bubble_sort** function accepts an array of integers and sorts them
in an ascending order of magnitude. The second function, the **bubble_sort_by** requires that we make use of ruby's block
and yield feature to pass in a predicate to the sort function.
